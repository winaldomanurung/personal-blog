# How do I get into running?

I was always a highly-active person in my teenager's time. I played a lot of football games with my friends where we were simply playing for the sake of fun. It became a habit until my college time. But, shortly after I went to the working life, it was just really hard to keep up with the healthy lifestyle since a big portion of my time was spent commuting and working. I, ultimately, gained a lot of weight due to consuming more calories than burning them. I weighed 85 kg, which is my highest body weight ever. I decided that I had to change before it went too far and started to run. I ran every day at 6 p.m. in my neighborhood area and easily burnt 10 kg in my 2 months of running. But, that's all. After I'd reached my weight goal, I started slacking again. I ate much and didn't do any exercise until I weighed more than I should, then I went to another cycle of exercising-slacking-gaining weight-exercising-slacking, and so on.
However, starting this year, I decided to do things differently. I aimed for a slow and steady daily exercise, but the most important thing was that I could do it consistently. I started to run at a very low distance, but I did it every day. After I gained my strength and my stamina became better, I added the running distance but aimed for lower intensity.

# What's my plan for running?

I plan to keep it simple with running. No excessive running gears that would likely end up being in the stack of things that I don't use that often. I always keep in mind that there won't be impulsive buying related to this. I will consider everything that I would buy carefully. Right now, I just have two pairs of running shoes. I've always wanted to buy a smartwatch to track my running session, but I still carefully think about the best choice. But, there's it. I think that's all the core gear that I'll need for every running session. Maybe a couple of other shoes if I want to take my running to the next level, since until now, I've always used the same running shoes for my session, which is my only kind of session, btw. Near time in the near future, I need to learn another type of running session and what shoes that fit those sessions.

Next year, I plan to join several half-marathons in my country. But it is just the icing on the cake. What really matters is that I can train myself to do things consistently, building my mental strength to do things that I don't really like but have to do.
