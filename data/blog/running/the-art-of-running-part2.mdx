# What's changing?

A lot of things have changed in the past 6 months. I have to move to another city for my work relocation. Also, this month, after years of dating with my girlfriend, we finally got married. This event, which was planned since a year ago, took a lot of our times and energy since a lot of things need a careful thought.

# What's my plan?

Unfortunately, I may not get a chance to run either FM or even HM anytime soon. Yes, I will start my running routine again as soon as possible, yet the possibility to do a marathon seems low.
