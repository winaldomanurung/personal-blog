# How I get into running?

I was always a highly-active person in my teenager's time. I played a lot of football games with my friends where we were simply play for the sake of fun. It became a habit until my college time. But, shortly after I went to the working life, it was just really hard to keep up with the healthy lifestyle since a big portion of my time was seized for commuting and working. I, ultimately, gaining a lot of weight due to consuming more calories than burning them. I weighted 85 kg, which is my highest body weight ever. I decided that I have to change before it gone too far and started to run. I ran every day at 6 p.m in my neighboorhood area and easily burnt 10 kg in my 2 months of running. But, that's all. After I've reached my weight-goal, I started slacking again. I ate much, didn't do any exercise, until I weighed more than I should, then I went to another cycle of exercising-slacking-gaining weight-exercising-slacking, and so on.
However, starting this year, I decided to do things differently. I aimed for a slow and steady daily exercise, but the most important thing was that I can do it consistently. I started to run in a very low distance, but I did it everyday. After I gained my strength and my stamina became better, I add the running distance, but aimed for lower intensity.

# What's my plan with running?

I plan to keep it simple with running. No excessive running gears that would likely end up being in the stack of things that I don't use that often. I always keep in mind that there won't be impulsive buying related to this. I will consider everything that I would buy carefully. Right now, I just have two pairs of running shoes. I've always wanted to buy a smartwatch to track my running session, but I still carefully think about the best choice. But, there's it. I think that's all the core gears that I'll need for every running session. Maybe a couple of other shoes if I really want to take my running to the next level, since until now, I've always used the same running shoes for my session, which is my only kind of session, btw. Near time in the future, I need to learn another type of running sessions and what shoes that really fits those sessions.

Next year, I plan to join several half-marathons in my country. But it is just the icing of the cake. What really matter is that I can train myself to do things consistently, building my mental strength to do things that I don't really like but have to do.
