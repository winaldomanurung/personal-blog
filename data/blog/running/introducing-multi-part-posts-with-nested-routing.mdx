# Part 1

The blog template supports posts in nested sub-folders. This helps in organisation and can be used to group posts of similar content e.g. a multi-part series. This post is itself an example of a nested route! It's located in the `/data/blog/nested-route` folder.

## The Starting Point

I was always a highly-active person in my teenager's time. I played a lot of football games with my friends where we were simply play for the sake of fun. It became a habit until my college time. But, shortly after I went to the working life, it was just really hard to keep up with the healthy lifestyle since a big portion of my time was seized for commuting and working. I, ultimately, gaining a lot of weight due to consuming more calories than burning them. I weighted 85 kg, which is my highest body weight ever. I decided that I have to change before it gone too far and started to run. I ran every day at 6 p.m in my neighboorhood area and easily burnt 10 kg in my 2 months of running.

## Use Cases

Here are some reasons to use nested routes

- More logical content organisation (blogs will still be displayed based on the created date)
- Multi-part posts
- Different sub-routes for each author
- Internationalization (though it would be recommended to use [Next.js built-in i8n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing))

## Note

- The previous/next post links at bottom of the template are currently sorted by date. One could explore modifying the template to refer the reader to the previous/next post in the series, rather than by date.
