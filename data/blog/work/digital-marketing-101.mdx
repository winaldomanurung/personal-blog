## Sales Funnel Fundamental

### Establish Your Goals

You can start by determining your goals for your digital marketing journey. It can be many things. For example, you could be a freelancer that looking to build strategies for client, or an entrepreneur wanting to sell a digital product, or maybe you are a craftman who want to show your work to the world.

The most important thing is that you have ONE and ONLY ONE goal to focus on as you are going to do your journey. You can, of course, create several micro goals that in the end will help you to achieve your ONE big macro goal.

Here is a quick cheat sheet about how you can choose your goal:

- What are you trying to achieve?
- Are you looking to build a social media presence?
- Are you wanting more email subscribers?
- Are you just wanting to generate more revenue?

Once you have chose your goal, you need to think about the end scenarion in your mind. What is the measure of success of your campaigns? Or how will you know when you will have 'suceeded'?
You can always try to build your audience, subscribers or followers, but, you should always be thinking about how that is going to generate leads for yout business that are going to turn into sales. Because, it's very easy to get drown and spend a lot of time and money to craft something for your audience, but if all of that efforts are not going to help you grow your business or your financial strength, then it might be time to reassess where your time and money are better spent.

### Identify Your Ideal Customer Avatars

You need to identify your target audience and how are you catering your content to them. For this, you need to create a fictious customer persona. This is very useful to help you make better marketing decisions.

</div>

We can use the 'Who are they?' section for determining our ads targetting. In 'Goals and values' section, you can predict about what drives your customer, what do they want to accomplish in the short term and the long term.

For 'Pain points' section, this is an interesting one, because you have to be a little bit prepared for the fact that maybe someone in the past has offered them a similar product or service to what you are offering, and it might be wasn't such a good experience for them. And that's the reason that they are not super likely to purchase your product.

In ' Interests' section, this is more just for you to get a sense of, maybe some famous authors or famous media personalities, that you can target of by leveraging their audience.

Last but not least, the 'Objections' section, you can come up with objections that you think people would have to buying your product based on your research.

We can make several personas in our list and targetting our ads to each of them. People are so much more likely to buy something if they feel like the seller is actually talking directly to them.

All of these are made up by your predictions, but once you have a real customer and sales, you have to adjust this buyer persona based on your data, so you could make a more successful campaign.

### Why Funnels Are the Key to Your Success

At the very core, funnels are just the process of building a relationship with your audience. This is the place where you make your customers like and trust you.

Funnels are very essential for your business growth. They are the ones that make difference between the best product and the best marketed product. The best selling books aren't necessarily the best written, but they are the ones that best marketed. They are packaged, presented, and sold in a way that makes them discoverable and shareable as well as appealing for customers to purchase, which then give them the illusion of being the best. And on the other side, there are likely many incredibly well-written and life-changing books that will remain completely unknown because of a lack of marketing.

What's interesting about funnels is that the most effective sales funnel doesn't really end at the sale. Actually, it never ends. It's also about the exposure to the brand everywhere you, where people crave for new product-line.

So, what actually is a sales or marketing funnel and how does it look in its most basic form?

A marketing funnel is a framework that businesses use to turn strangers into customers. The funnel framework is essentially based on the idea that the number of people you attract to the initial meeting point of your business, whether that's a website or social media profile, is much larger than the fraction of those people who will still show interest in your business, to far enough down the tunnel that become leads and eventually customers. So at the top of the funnel, naturally you will have the largest audience of strangers who are just discovering your business for the first time through blog posts and social media posts and videos that are out there while through the middle of the funnel.

Your goal is to capture those visitors and turn them into email subscribers so that you can eventually get them to the bottom of the funnel where they turn into targeted customers, where your audience is much, much smaller, which is where the shape of the funnel comes in.

Now when we talk about what you should actually create for your audience at each stage and what you should be measuring to actually determine the success of each stage, we'll be talking about that in a bit more depth by focusing on each stage in the following few lessons. And we will primarily at this stage be focusing on organic content, which is things like blog posts and email marketing and social media posts.

Because once you begin advertising, you will essentially be amplifying your organic efforts by putting some money behind the exact strategies we'll be talking about with our organic efforts.

But we will talk more about paid advertising a little later on. I'm just trying to introduce you to the concepts of building out a funnel by talking about topics that you're probably already a little bit more familiar with, such as just posting on social media and writing blog posts.

### Top Of The Funnel Strategy

Top of funnel is the stage about increasing the visibility of your business and making your targeted audience aware of the fact your company exists. People at this stage of the funnel are really not ready to buy anything from you. They're just kind of getting to know you and your business. So in practice, the top of the funnel might look like someone maybe reading a blog post that you wrote or viewing one of your YouTube videos or just engaging on social media. Your goal at this stage is really just to attract as many targeted visitors as possible with really relevant content. Thing to keep in mind is that you don't just want to be attracting anyone and everyone to your website or social profile. You want to be attracting the right kind of audience.

Next, let's focus on the metrics that you want to be measuring at this stage of the funnel. If you don't have a website yet and your online presence is just on social media for now, then you could just measure things like engagement on your posts and the number of video views or new followers at this stage.

But ideally you will have a website for your business at some point, in which case these are the metrics that you want to be measuring. So you want to be measuring the overall web traffic to your site and then you want to really narrow in on the number or the percentage of new sessions. So not just the people who are continuously returning to your website and reading more and more blog posts, but you want to see what new people are finding you for the very first time through your website.

Then you want to be focusing and looking at the bounce rate, which is the metric that's going to tell you the percentage of the traffic or the sessions that ended with that user not taking any further action on your site and then your traffic per channel.

So this is a metric that's going to tell you what is actually bringing people to your website. Are they getting there through a link that they've clicked on via email, or have they found you organically through Google or have they been sent there through social media? And this will really allow you to cater your strategy to the channel that is sending people to your website and getting them to read that content. You can track all of this really easily through Google Analytics for free.

To do top funnel marketing, you can do several strategies:

- Content Marketing
- PR or Guest Posts
- Social Media Marketing
- Search Engine Optimisation
- Influencers/ Joint Ventures
- Paid Media

### Middle of the Funnel Strategy

The middle of the funnel is often overlooked by those who are new to online marketing. Because it's kind of natural to just want to skip straight ahead and ask for the sale when you're first starting out in this online marketing world. But the middle of the funnel is actually where you build enough trust that people then start showing an interest in what you do and what you have to offer. And your job in the middle of the funnel is just to provide enough value that your audience is willing to give you a piece of their contact information, which is when marketers will say that a visitor or your audience becomes a lead, that you can then use that lead and that information on your email list to nurture your relationship with them. In your online business, the middle of the funnel can look likea free piece of content that your visitors can access by submitting their email address in a contact form, for example. So your goal at this stage is just to convert as many website or social media visitors into leads as possible. But again, we're looking for targeted leads.

So your metrics at this stage would be:

- Visitor-to-lead conversion rate
- Number of subscribers/leads
- Email open and click rates

`Visitor-to-lead conversion rate` will to tell you what percentage of your website visitors become leads. Certain email marketing integrations that provide you with pop ups or embedded forms will actually give you that metric of there was 100 people who saw this form and two of them signed up. So then you know, your conversion rate is 2%. But otherwise you can also track this through Google Analytics as well.

Then your second metric, `number of subscribers/leads`, is the actual number of people on your email list. So that's exactly just how much your email list is growing over time. You can track that growth and also see if it's associated with any of your top of funnel strategies. So are you doing something at the top of funnel that is doing really well and actually moving people down into converting them into leads and into the middle of your funnel.

Next is your `email open and click rates`. That's going to tell you how active and engaged your leads actually are, because at the end of the day, there's absolutely no sense in having a hundred thousand email subscribers if they're not actually reading your emails. So make sure to check in on what your subscribers are actually doing with the emails you're sending to them. And it can also be a really good practice and habit to get into to clean up your email list. If you have someone on your email list that's been there for a year and hasn't opened a single email, get rid of them, delete them because you're paying to have a certain number of email subscribers on your email list. And if they're not doing their job by engaging with you, then you shouldn't have to keep them on your email list. And some of the best marketers in this world do that very regularly through automation. So they'll actually have automation set up to say if someone hasn't opened my email in 3 or 4 months, hasn't opened any emails in 3 or 4 months, just get rid of them or re-engage them and send them an email saying, Do you still want to hear from me? Are you still reading my stuff? Or What can I do better? And then if they don't open those, then just fully get rid of them.

So based on those metrics, you might have already guessed that your content and strategy at this level of your funnel is going to be all about email marketing. Like I said at the top of your funnel, you have a lot of different strategies. Once you get to the middle of the funnel, it's all about nurturing that relationship through your emails.

So building an email list is smart, not just because it's a really great way to nurture your audience and eventually sell them your product or service, But also because that is data that you own that no one can take away from you. So it's important for you to not just continue to write great blog content and produce great videos or social media posts, but actually think about how to get people's email addresses in exchange for something. And this is where an opt in or a lead magnet will come into play.

So it can be something as simple as just a PDF or an ebook, but it's not enough to just create a great lead magnet for your business or your industry. You also want to be thinking about how you're going to be promoting it and also what product you will be selling to the people who opt in to it later. The more closely related all of your content is, the more seamless your actual sales funnel will be.

### Bottom of the Funnel Strategy

### Cater to the Buyer's Journey

I know that the intricacies of each stage of the funnel might sound a bit complicated when you're first starting out, So I wanted to simplify this by assuring you that all you really doing with your funnel and the tactics at each stage is just giving your audience the type of content that caters to their mindset along their buying journey.

So here's what I mean by this. You might have heard about a variation of this kind of customer flow.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Customer Journey](/static/images/digital-marketing/journey.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Customer Journey</div>
</div>

All the different funnel stages are really just the three different stages of the buyer's journey and their mindset. All customers have to start at the awareness stage before they can even consider purchasing your product or service. The top of funnel strategies are catering to people at the awareness stage where they're just looking for answers and resources and looking to be educated and looking for opinions or insight or inspiration.

Then the middle of the funnel strategies are catering to people at the evaluate or consideration stages, where people are doing a bit more heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them, which is where the trainings and the free opt ins come into play because they're looking for a little bit more insight on who you are and whether they should trust you and your business.

Then the bottom of the funnel caters to people at the decision or the purchase stage where they're just figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer and whether that is the right move for them.

How quickly someone moves from not knowing anything about you, to them, buying your product or service will depend on a few things. And these are the main ones that I want you to think about.

So the first is `the time investment required on the customer's end`. As in, are they signing up for a year long program that has weekly calls and a lot of work required in between those calls? Then you can bet that someone would really sit on that decision for a while, several weeks or even months maybe. Whereas if your offer is a 30 minute haircut because you own a barber shop near their house, then that is a decision they might make on the spot. Think about it in terms of the time that it takes people to decide on which university or college to go to, depending on the degree. It might be a 3 or 4 year commitment. That's one of the biggest decisions that you will ever make in terms of time.

Then there's `the actual monetary investment required on the customer's end`. So people valued their time. But it's no secret that the biggest hurdle for a lot of people comes down to the price tag. If what you're selling is a $5,000 handbag, you're going to have to do a lot more work to get that sale than someone selling a $100 knockoff.

And the final point is `how closely your business model fits into what is important to them`. This is one that people often forget, especially people for whom this is not a part of their purchasing decisions. So this is another one of those mistakes where business owners are thinking about how they purchase, not how their customers make purchasing decisions. But you would actually be amazed at how much our values are influencing our day to day purchasing decisions. They can actually overtake the other two objections.

So using Tesla as an example, people generally buy a Tesla for one of two reasons. Either the environment is important to them and they want to do their part to build a sustainable future, or they love what the Tesla represents in terms of innovation, design, speed and an overall cool factor, I guess. So it's a status car either way, depending on which side of that fence they sit on, or maybe it's both.

And the best businesses really understand that people feel first and they think second.

Now, the reason that this plays into the buyer's journey is because if your product or service is exactly what someone is looking for and it's aligned with their mission and vision, they are so much more likely to make a quicker purchasing decision and also less likely to refund. Now, if you all you really have is features and benefits and there's no emotional connection there, it's going to take a lot longer to convince someone to make that purchasing decision.

So of course, the longer this process takes, the more content you will have to create to take your audience through to a purchasing decision for a quick two hour, $10 course, you can maybe even just advertise it straight away to complete strangers out there and get people to purchase it as long as it's aligned with what they're looking for.

Now, for $1,000 a month, three month minimum commitment on an digital marketing agency package, for example, you would then have to create videos and blog posts. And social media posts and give out free trainings and ebooks and free consultations and provide them with a really professional proposal and maybe a presentation in order to secure that purchasing decision.

But knowing this and tapping into how people think and what they really need from you and how they need information presented to them is exactly what's going to take your funnel from being unnecessarily long or far too short to being just right.
