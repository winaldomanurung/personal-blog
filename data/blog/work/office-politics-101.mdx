## Overview and Table of Content

I've been working for 7 years since I graduated from college, and there are a lot of things (good and bad) that I've learned throughout that time.
So this is an overview of things, `politics-related`, that I've learned throughout the working life in an Indonesia's corporation.

## Slacking is becoming more common for older workers

When I first started, I always thought, `What? You really spend 30 years of your life working, but end up just as a staff?` or `Are you in your right mind, you've been working in the same position for almost ten years? What's wrong with you?`, whenever I met much older coworkers. I know that sounds harsh, but for a young mind like mine, that's really strange. Yes, I was filled with full-energy and motivation as a new employee. I still didn't see a lot of things that could cause those things.

### Root cause

First of all, there are just not enough higher positions for every employees to advance. We all know that an organisation consist of a pyramid-like structure, where there will always much larger numbers of members being in the lower position. This block the opportunity for every person in that organisation to taste the sweetness of higher position. And the longer you wait for advancing to higher position the harder it will get, because there will always be a younger and newer person, coming with a better and more modern knowledge that comes to your office, which eventually will become a new member in queueing line.

### Solution

Climb that corporate ladder as fast as you can. Yes, I know that it sounds obvious, but really, it is what it is. The problem is that not everyone wants to do the hardwork for that. That's why there is a saying `The easiest way to climb the corporate ladder is by climbing the stack of your colleague's dead corpses`.

## Grinding is not enough, you have to be visible

Yeah, hard work is good, smart work is even better, but what really makes you advance is being known for that. You must always advocate yourself for every single of good work that you do, because no one else will do it for you. I can always see that a good worker in my company doesn't get higher promotion not because they did a shitty job. Actually, they do a really good job and even work harder than anyone else, but the problem is that they don't really have the ability to present themselves for the good work they do. In contrast, a decent coworker who is able to present themselves well, get all the spotlight.

### Solution

Communication skills are very important. Not just because it will hep you to create a good relationship with other but also to make yourself more visible. A visible person will always a person that has a good communication skills. If those are not really your forte, then you can try to join a highly visible group project. This type of project will atrract a lot of people with good work and communication skills. It will definitely help you honing those skills simply just being around them.

We switched the MDX bundler from [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler).
This uses [xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) under the hood, the latest micromark 3 and remark, rehype libraries.

**Warning:** If you were using custom remark or rehype libraries, please upgrade to micromark 3 compatible ones. If you are upgrading, please delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to avoid having past dependencies related issues.

[xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) contains multiple improvements over [@mdx-js/mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), the compiler used internally by next-mdx-remote, but there might be some breaking behaviour changes.
Please check your markdown output to verify.

Some new possibilities include loading components directly in the mdx file using the import syntax and including js code which could be compiled and bundled at the build step.

For example, the following jsx snippet can be used directly in an MDX file to render the page title component:

```jsx
// Or import PageTitle from './components/PageTitle.js' if you are using js
import PageTitle from './components/PageTitle.tsx'
;<PageTitle> Using JSX components in MDX </PageTitle>
```

The default configuration resolves all components relative to the `components` directory.

**Note**:
Components which require external image loaders also require additional esbuild configuration.
Components which are dependent on global application state on lifecycle like the Nextjs `Link` component would also not work with this setup as each mdx file is built independently.
For such cases, it is better to use component substitution.

## You won't knock it out by yourself

Politics is just another word for relationship. Get good at communicating. Communicate descent well. Learn how to talk to people and manage the relationship like you would with your family or friends. Sometimes there are things you need to say or do that you don't feel like. Tell your spouse you love them even if your mad, show up at your friends dad's funeral even though you didn't know him. This isn't kissing ass or playing political games, it's being a human treating others like humans.

### Solution

You need to realize that you work in a corporation, where office politics take parts, whether you like it or not. Consider this as part of your learning. Many people including myself think that `I don't need to play politics`. But the harsh truth is that the games get played with or without your consent. If you really want to advance, don't be so passive.

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),
the `toc` variable containing all the top level headings of the document is passed to the MDX file and can be styled accordingly.
To make generating a table of contents (TOC) simple, you can use the existing `TOCInline` component.

For example, the TOC in this post was generated with the following code:

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />
```

You can customise the headings that are displayed by configuring the `fromHeading` and `toHeading` props, or exclude particular headings
by passing a string or a string array to the `exclude` prop. By default, all headings that are of depth 3 or smaller are indented. This can be configured by changing the `indentDepth` property.
A `asDisclosure` prop can be used to render the TOC within an expandable disclosure element.

Here's the full TOC rendered in a disclosure element.

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />
```

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## Generalist or T-shaped is the way to go

There are three types of person in every industry.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Type of person](/static/images/office-politics/individuals.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Type of Person</div>
</div>

First one is `I-shaped` person, an individual that developed great profound knowledge and expertise in one single discipline but have little knowledge outside that. We often call this as `specialist`.

The second one is a `generalist`, which is an individual with knowledge in several disciplines who are capable of many things though he/she neither have the specialty nor the expertise in any of them.

Last but not least, there is a `T-shaped` person. T-shaped is an individuals who not only has a relatively good knowledge about many disciplines, but also an expert in one of them. We can see this person as a combination of I-shaped and generalist.

The thing is, when you want to be in a higher position, you need to have a good knowledge about a lot of things. You don't just need to know about technical aspects of your field, but also to possess the management skills. That's why being generalist, or even better, being a T-shaped person is the way to go if you really want to achieve a high position in your workfield. Keep in mind, that I don't say being a specialist is a bad thing. In fact, there are several fields that require this type of person to do more specialize jobs that pay certainly well. But, for being a leader, I don't see this type of person as a good choice.
