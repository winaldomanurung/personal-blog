# The Starting Point

I first started to learn to code back in 2018, thanks to a platform called [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I learned about Python üêç every day after I came back from my work. It was a really tiring experience, but was a very valuable moment that changed my view about coding. I started just for the sake of curiosity but ended up craving more. I realized that coding is a superpower. I can create things from nothing and show them to the world with little or even no cost. I could create a whole new community from scratch by making a forum, I could sell things online by creating a marketplace, could spread value to society by creating a blog, and so on. Eventhough, I still didn't have the capability yet to do that thing, I know that the potential is there. Heck yeah, the possibilities are endless.

# The Present

I have already decided that I don't want to go through a complete career restart and the hustle needed for a newcomer in the industry. Mind you, currently, the tech field is in the winter phase where a lot of people have difficulty finding jobs, and a lot of companies are doing massive layoffs. So, I don't think that starting a new career is a good move. However, I never thought about leaving coding, I know that the spark is still there, and I still want to create things as well as cope with the development of this industry. I never planned to stop. Besides, there are still opportunities to do work related to this field by freelancing or contract-based projects. So, I still think that I need to learn more.

Furthermore, I still can use this skill for something important, which is sharing it with society. I could build a community where I gather people who want to learn, no matter what is their background, how old they are, or what is their education. That's why I started Kodepatra. I see it as a platform where I can pour my insights so the world can see them.

# The Plan

Currently, I am developing a website related to the online learning platform for Kodepatra üòé. I will share my knowledge and insights about the fast-changing and rapid development of the coding field on that website, where I will share it for free, for essential and basic stuff, or with charge, for premium content. I tried my best to implement the best practices, both for the planning and development process related to this. I know that this will become pretty useful for my skills development, as well as my management and project planning skills.

For now, the website is 80% ready. All of the features were completed, even though I still need to test them further.‚ù§Ô∏è

</div>

There are a lot of features, where you can divide the website into three sides:

- user side
- instructor side
- admin side

Each one of them has its unique difficulty to develop. On the `user side`, I struggle a lot with payment gateway configuration, since the website needs to talk to a third party for the payment gateway, in this case, I use [Midtrans](https://midtrans.com/), which is one of the biggest payment gateway providers in Indonesia. So, I need to configure how users could request for payment interface, where then they could the payment related to stuff they added to the cart. The problem is, that whenever the user makes the payment, my system has to know about the payment being made. This is needed because my system needs to open the access for the user, so the user can watch the course they bought. This has to be made automatically.

For the `instructor side`, I found it difficult to integrate Youtube API for my uploaded course. So, I decided to go with Youtube to host my videos because they are free and I didn't need to hassle with storage, since this is still in early development. I needed to track the duration of every video I uploaded so it could be synced with the data in my database. Apart from that, the course progress tracking also became a new thing for me. üëç

Last but not least, the `admin side`. Actually, I didn't find much difficulty related to this side, since it was basically about tracking things that the users and instructors did. However, developing a coupon feature was a whole new knowledge for me.

I still have a lot of homework, for instance, I still need to figure out about the deployment, the marketing, and also the process of content creation. I know that there is a hell of work to do, but, I know that these all will be worth it in the future. So, I guess I will end this article and see you in the next part.

Thank you. üôè
