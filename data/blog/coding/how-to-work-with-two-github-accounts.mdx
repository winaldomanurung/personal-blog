## Create SSH keys for all of your github accounts

First of all, make sure you are on your `.ssh` folder:

```
  $ cd ~/.ssh
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![cd ~/.ssh](/static/images/coding/github-1.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Change Directory to /.ssh</div>
</div>

Then, you need to make SSH keys for your accounts. To generate a new SSH key for each GitHub account, open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `github-email@example.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub account:

```
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-email@example.com" -f "github-username"
```

-C stands for comment to help identify your ssh key

-f stands for the file name where your ssh key get saved

Or you can specify the filename later by inputting command:

```
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-email@example.com" -f "github-username"
```

..., and inputting a unique filename when prompted. In this case, I use github-username for my `filename`. For `passphrase`, you can choose whatever you want. In this case, I don't use any passphrase.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Creating SSH Key](/static/images/coding/github-2.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Creating SSH Key</div>
</div>

Then, do the same thing for your other github account.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Creating SSH Key for Other Account](/static/images/coding/github-3.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Creating SSH Key for Other Account</div>
</div>

## Adding SSH keys to SSH Agent

After we created our SSH keys, we have to add them to the SSH Agent so it can be used.

```
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/filename1
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/filename2
```

For me it is:

```
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">

  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Adding SSH Key to SSH Agent</div>
</div>

## Adding SSH Public Key to the Github

Next step is we need to add the public keys and add it to corresponding Github accounts.

For this, we need to do two steps:

### 1. Copy the public key

We can do this by opening the .pub file using vim and copy the content of that file. This is the command for that:

```
  vim ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung.pub
  vim ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra.pub

```

OR, if we use Mac, we can directly copy the content of the public key file in the clipboard.

```
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung.pub
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra.pub
```

### 2. Paste the public key on Github

- Sign in to Github Account
- Goto Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key
- Paste your copied public key and give it a Title of your choice.

Do this with both of your accounts.

## Create a Config File and Make Host Entries

The ~/.ssh/config file allows us specify many config options for SSH.

If config file not already exists then create one (make sure you are in ~/.ssh directory)

```
     touch config
```

The commands below opens config in your default editor....Likely TextEdit, VS Code.

```
     open config
```

Now we need to add these lines to the file, each block corresponding to each account we created earlier.

```
     #github-winaldomanurung account
     Host github.com-winaldomanurung
          HostName github.com
          User git
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung

     #kodepatra account
     Host github.com-kodepatra
          HostName github.com
          User git
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra

```

## Cloning GitHub repositories using different accounts

So we are done with our setups and now its time to see it in action. We will clone a repository using one of the account we have added.

Make a new project folder where you want to clone your repository and go to that directory from your terminal.

For Example: I am making a repository on my personal github account and naming it GitLearn Now for cloning the repo use the below command:

```
    git clone git@github.com-{your-username}:{owner-user-name}/{the-repo-name}.git

    [e.g.] git clone git@github.com-winaldomanurung:winaldomanurung/GitLearn.git
```

## Finally

From now on, to ensure that our commits and pushes from each repository on the system uses the correct GitHub user â€” we will have to configure user.email and user.name in every repository freshly cloned or existing before.

To do this use the following commands.

```
     git config user.email "github-email-1@gmail.com"
     git config user.name "github-username-1"

     git config user.email "github-email-2@gmail.com"
     git config user.name "github-username-2"
```

Pick the correct pair for your repository accordingly.

To push or pull to the correct account we need to add the remote origin to the project

```

     git remote add origin git@github.com-winaldomanurung:winaldomanurung

     git remote add origin git@github.com-kodepatra:kodepatra
```

Now you can use:

```
     git push

     git pull
git remote add origin git@github.com:kodepatra/next-tutorial.git

```
