In this article, I will share how I could manage to work with two (or more) Github accounts within the same computer.

I have two GitHub accounts, which are [winaldomanurung](https://github.com/winaldomanurung) and [kodepatra](https://github.com/kodepatra). So, I planned to use this two accounts in my Linux Ubuntu machine.

You can see the outline of this article below:

## Create SSH keys for all of your github accounts

First of all, make sure you are on your `.ssh` folder:

```
  $ cd ~/.ssh
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![cd ~/.ssh](/static/images/coding/github-1.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Change Directory to /.ssh</div>
</div>

Then, you need to make SSH keys for your accounts. To generate a new SSH key for each GitHub account, open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `github-email@example.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub account:

```
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-email@example.com" -f "github-username"
```

-C stands for comment to help identify your ssh key

-f stands for the file name where your ssh key get saved

Or you can specify the filename later by inputting command:

```
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-email@example.com"
```

..., and inputting a unique filename when prompted. In this case, I use github-username for my `filename`. For `passphrase`, you can choose whatever you want. In this case, I don't use any passphrase.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Creating SSH Key](/static/images/coding/github-2.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Creating SSH Key</div>
</div>

Then, do the same thing for your other github account.

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Creating SSH Key for Other Account](/static/images/coding/github-3.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Creating SSH Key for Other Account</div>
</div>

## Adding SSH keys to SSH Agent

After we created our SSH keys, we have to add them to the SSH Agent so it can be used.

First, we need to check if SSH Agent is running by using this command:

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/filename1
ssh-add ~/.ssh/filename2
```

For me it is:

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra
```

<div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden ">
  ![Adding SSH Key to SSH Agent](/static/images/coding/github-4.png)
  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Adding SSH Key to SSH Agent</div>
</div>

You can verify this step by using:

```
ssh-add -l
```

## Adding SSH Public Key to the Github

Next step is we need to add the public keys and add it to corresponding Github accounts.

For this, we need to do two steps:

### 1. Copy the public key

We can do this by opening the .pub file using vim and copy the content of that file. This is the command for that:

```
vim ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung.pub
vim ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra.pub

```

Another way, if we use Mac, we can directly copy the content of the public key file in the clipboard.

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung.pub
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra.pub
```

And if we use Linux, we can show (and then copy) the key with command:

```
cat ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung.pub
cat ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra.pub
```

### 2. Paste the public key on Github

- Sign in to Github Account
- Goto Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key
- Paste your copied public key and give it a Title of your choice.

Do this with both of your accounts.

## Create a Config File and Make Host Entries

The ~/.ssh/config file allows us specify many config options for SSH.

If config file not already exists then create one (make sure you are in ~/.ssh directory)

```
touch config
```

The commands below opens config in your default editor....Likely TextEdit, VS Code.

```
open config
```

Now we need to add these lines to the file, each block corresponding to each account we created earlier.

```
#github-winaldomanurung account
Host winaldomanurung github.com
     HostName github.com
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-winaldomanurung

#kodepatra account
Host kodepatra github.com
     HostName github.com
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-kodepatra

```

To test that the keys are configured correctly, you can use command:

```
ssh -T git@github.com-account1
ssh -T git@github.com-account2

```

OR in my case:

```
ssh -T git@github.com-winaldomanurung
ssh -T git@github.com-kodepatra

```

If everythings are set correctly, you will be greeted with a welcome message.

## Cloning GitHub repositories using different accounts

So we are done with our setups and now its time to see it in action. We will clone a repository using one of the account we have added.

Make a new project folder where you want to clone your repository and go to that directory from your terminal.

For Example: I am making a repository on my personal github account and naming it GitLearn Now for cloning the repo use the below command:

```
    git clone git@github.com-{your-username}:{owner-user-name}/{the-repo-name}.git

    [e.g.] git clone git@github.com-winaldomanurung:winaldomanurung/GitLearn.git
```

## Finally

From now on, to ensure that our commits and pushes from each repository on the system uses the correct GitHub user â€” we will have to configure user.email and user.name in every repository freshly cloned or existing before.

To do this use the following commands.

```
git config user.email "github-email-1@gmail.com"
git config user.name "github-username-1"

git config user.email "github-email-2@gmail.com"
git config user.name "github-username-2"
```

Pick the correct pair for your repository accordingly.

To push or pull to the correct account we need to add the remote origin to the project

```
git remote add origin git@winaldomanurung:winaldomanurung/test-repo.git
git remote add origin git@kodepatra:kodepatra/test-repo.git
```

In this command, the `winaldomanurung` and `kodepatra` parts after the git@ is the alias for Host that we created in the config file.

Now you can use:

```
git push

git pull

```

If you want to create a new and fresh project, for example, you want to install Next.app using command 'npx create-next-app', you need to change your user.name and user.email globally before running the 'npx create-next-app' command. You can do this by:

```
git config user.email "github-email@gmail.com"
git config user.name "github-username"
```

For example, I want to install Next.app using my kodepatra account. Then I need to do this:

```
git config user.email "kodepatra@gmail.com"
git config user.name "kodepatra"
```

You can check the global user data by using:

```
git config --list
```

Then you can add the remote to the repository by adding command:

```
git remote add origin git@kodepatra:kodepatra/test-repo.git
```
