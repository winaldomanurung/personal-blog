## Overview and Table of Content

I've been working for 7 years since I graduated from college, and there are a lot of things (good and bad) that I've learned throughout that time.
So this is an overview of things, `politics-related`, that I've learned throughout my working life in an Indonesia corporation.

## Slacking is becoming more common for older workers

When I first started, I always thought, `What? You spend 30 years of your life working, but end up just as a staff?` or `Are you in your right mind, you've been working in the same position for almost ten years? What's wrong with you?`, whenever I met much older coworkers. I know that sounds harsh, but for a young mind like mine, that's strange. Yes, I was filled with full energy and motivation as a new employee. I still didn't see a lot of things that could cause those things.

### Root cause

First of all, there are just not enough higher positions for every employee to advance. We all know that an organization consists of a pyramid-like structure, where there will always much larger numbers of members being in the lower position. This blocks the opportunity for every person in that organization to taste the sweetness of a higher position. And the longer you wait to advance to a higher position the harder it will get, because there will always be a younger and newer person, coming with a better and more modern knowledge that comes to your office, which eventually will become a new member in queueing line.

### Solution

Climb that corporate ladder as fast as you can. Yes, I know that it sounds obvious, but really, it is what it is. The problem is that not everyone wants to do the hard work for that. That's why there is a saying `The easiest way to climb the corporate ladder is by climbing the stack of your colleague's dead corpses`.

## Grinding is not enough, you have to be visible

Yeah, hard work is good, and smart work is even better, but what really makes you advance is being known for that. You must always advocate yourself for every single good work that you do because no one else will do it for you. I can always see that a good worker in my company doesn't get higher promotion not because they did a shitty job. Actually, they do a really good job and even work harder than anyone else, but the problem is that they can't present themselves for the good work they do. In contrast, a decent coworker who is able to present themselves well gets all the spotlight.

### Solution

Communication skills are very important. Not just because it will help you to create a good relationship with others but also to make yourself more visible. A visible person will always be a person who has good communication skills. If those are not really your forte, then you can try to join a highly visible group project. This type of project will attract a lot of people with good work and communication skills. It will help you hone those skills simply by just being around them.

## You won't knock it out by yourself

Politics is just another word for relationships. Get good at communicating. Communicate descent well. Learn how to talk to people and manage the relationship like you would with your family or friends. Sometimes there are things you need to say or do that you don't feel like. Tell your spouse you love them even if you are mad, and show up at your friend's dad's funeral even though you don't know him. This isn't kissing ass or playing political games, it's being a human and treating others like humans.

### Solution

You need to realize that you work in a corporation, where office politics take part, whether you like it or not. Consider this as part of your learning. Many people including myself think that `I don't need to play politics`. But the harsh truth is that the games get played with or without your consent. If you really want to advance, don't be so passive.

## Generalist or T-shaped is the way to go

There are three types of people in every industry.

  <div className="mb-8 grid place-items-center font-bold">Type of Person</div>
</div>

The first one is an `I-shaped` person, an individual who developed great profound knowledge and expertise in one single discipline but has little knowledge outside that. We often call this a `specialist`.

The second one is a `generalist`, which is an individual with knowledge in several disciplines who is capable of many things though he/she neither has the specialty nor the expertise in any of them.

Last but not least, there is a `T-shaped` person. A T-shaped is an individual who not only has a relatively good knowledge about many disciplines but is also an expert in one of them. We can see this person as a combination of I-shaped and generalist.

The thing is, when you want to be in a higher position, you need to have a good knowledge about a lot of things. You don't just need to know about technical aspects of your field, but also to possess management skills. That's why being a generalist, or even better, being a T-shaped person is the way to go if you really want to achieve a high position in your work field. Keep in mind, that I don't say being a specialist is a bad thing. In fact, several fields require this type of person to do more specialized jobs that pay certainly well. But, for being a leader, I don't see this type of person as a good choice.
