I know that I am a little bit late to start my journey as a software developer. I was 28 years old when just started, while out there, there are a lot of young and brilliant people who start earlier. I know that I don't have a related background for this profession, while out there, there are a lot of people who graduated from computer science programs with distinction and have a lot of experience in their study time. For that, I realize that I have to shift my learning approach to a more aggressive strategy. I need to learn as much as possible in a short amount of time to advance my skills. In this article, I will draft several things that I will do while developing as an independent developer. I know that this might be not a perfect plan, but I will keep improving this plan over time.

## Keep a side project to work on and use the latest technology to keep me updated

I couldn't lie, this is one of the most difficult things to do since you have to go through a lot of different phases to do a side project. You need to learn the technology, plan the project, kick start the project, do some research, and trial and error which oftentimes leads to discouragement to continue the project. Yes, I can always buy a Udemy course, follow the technology introduction, and implement it in a project. However, I will likely get trapped in `tutorial hell` where I only rely on the course and don't have real experience to develop a project by myself. I believe the best way to cope with this problem is to create another project with a different model from the course's project and develop it by myself.

Shiny object syndrome also becomes a problem considering that there is a lot of new technology with a lot of exciting features and the so-called 'the future of programming' ideas behind it. To prevent this from happening, I believe that I need to be more focused on my career goals. I need to focus on things that I really need to learn by now, rather than the things that I want to learn.

## Having a 'patron' is a must

There will always be another person who is better than me, whether it is in technical skills or managerial skills. That's why I need to look up to that person and learn from them. That's what people usually call a mentor, or in my case, I refer to them as a `patron`. I don't think that they have to be my supervisor, leader, or something like that. As long as they possess great value and skills, I believe that it is okay to have them as my patrons. But, of course, it will become better if they have the direct ability to influence my upward movement and proactively advocate for me in my company.

## Keep honing my problem-solving skills

Whether I like it or not, I know that in the future I will have to face a lot of technical difficulties as time goes by, and I need to solve every problem if I want to become a better programmer. Now, as a newbie, I always get scared of data structure and algorithms. Why? Because I know, at the current time, I still don't have good fundamental knowledge related to this kind of problem. I still lack the understanding of both topics. I have done some research and got a lot of insights, based on the experience of other developers that it will be a great value for a developer to have a good understanding of DSA by grinding Leetcode problems. Heck, I didn't even know Leetcode when I read that article. I believe that going for the Leetcode problem is going to be worth it. I read a lot of good reviews from someone who manages to be hired by a really good company just by grinding Leetcode. A lot of people don't want to put the time and hassle into this kind of thing, but I believe that this is good for my development. The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in battle. I will make this a daily practice.

## Don't only focus on technical things but understand the management side and take initiative

I believe that the understanding of project management, how to work with other people, and marketing knowledge are the values that will become a critical difference between a freelance programmer and the usual programmer. A lot of usual programmers get stuck on their level because they focus too much on irrelevant things that have zero impact on the company and further, their career advancement. I won't lie, I was that kind of person in my job. That's why I need to change my approach and get a good understanding non-technical side as well as always take the initiative so I can thrive better both in my freelance career and full-time career as an engineer. Always be a consistent value maker and give valuable small contributions that will create a great long-term impact.

As for my career as an engineer in a common corporation, I believe that initiative-taking is like the career accelerator, not only for my job but also for every other job. Looking for opportunities or things that need to be improved, proactively creating the solution for that, executing the solution, and promoting it to your 'patron'. I believe it is better to create first and then promote it than the reverse because with the former, I can validate my idea first and by knowing that my idea is valid and doable, I will have the greater bargaining power to implement it. Don't sit around, waiting for the job to be given to you, waiting for the approval, etc. That will be a long time and slow career progression. Always look for huge impactful opportunities and ditch the significantly less valuable, low-priority things. This will make people look at you as an image of a creative and innovative person as well as an effective risk-taking leader. Always remember this mantra for fast-lightning career advancement: Building your image is like building an elevator in your career path while others still using a ladder.

## Being highly visible and having great communication and social skills

One thing is for sure the majority of humans are easily biased. That's why I need to have a good attitude and personality with every person that I meet. This will surely affect people who know me. People will easily prefer a person who has a great personality than say another colleague who is always bitter and pessimistic in their life. Reach out to people and offer them help. It might be exhausting and also there is a chance that my solution doesn't work, but at least I can always say sorry and own up to my mistakes. What's the most important thing is that I show that I am engaged and interested in helping.

It is also very important to be visible in public. Whether it is a social media, conference, or just a fun activity. I have to make sure that I always deliver my mind, presenting my idea and demonstrating my ability. I won't need fantastic singing skills if I don't have the courage to show them to the public, right? I believe that skills are something that you have to demonstrate publicly. If I can solve technical problems, then I am awesome. But if I can do that while also delivering it well with peers and management, then I will truly stand out.

That being said, the game plan that I will do in my life as an independent developer. I believe that this might change later in the future as I get new insight and knowledge in the industry. That's why I will keep updating this game plan and adapt to the industry movement.

Thank you. üôè
