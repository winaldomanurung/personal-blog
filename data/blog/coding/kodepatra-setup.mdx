# January, 3 2024

Today, I bought a domain called kodepatra.com at a local domain provider. It costed me about IDR 170.000 for the domain. Now, I just need to deploy my web app to the internet and connecting my domain to the deployed app. For a little bit context and information, I don't really have the experience to deploy a big app since I mainly focus only on the development process.

I have tried to deploy my project to Vercel, but I still need to host my database somewhere so I can test my app. There are several options to to this. First, I could try to host the database in a SaaS platform, such as AWS, GCP, or even things like DigitalOcean. The second option is to use a VPS and configure a database there. I've never have the experience with both of these methods, so I guess I will do some research for both.

# The Present

I have already decided that I don't want to go through a complete career restart and the hustle needed for a newcomer in the industry. Mind you, that currently the tech-field is in the winter-phase where a lot of people meet the difficulty to find jobs and a lot of companies are doing massive lay offs. So, I don't think that to start a new career is a good move. However, I never think about leaving coding, I know that the spark is still there, and I still want to create things as well as cope up with the development of this industry. I never planned to stop. Besides, there are still opportunities to do work related to this field by freelancing or contract based projects. So, I still think that I need to learn more.

Furthermore, I still can use this skill for something important, which is sharing it to the society. I could build a community where I gather people that want to learn, no matter what is their background, how old they are, or what is their education. That's why I started Kodepatra. I see it as a platform where I could pour my insights so the world can see it.

# The Plan

Currently, I am developing a website related to online-learning platform for Kodepatra üòé. I will share my knowledge and insights about the fast-changing and rapid development of coding field in that website, where I will share it for free, for essential and basic stuff, or with charge, for premium content. I tried my best to implement the best-practice, both for the planning and development process related to this. I know that this will become pretty useful for my skills development, as well as my management and project planning skills.

For now, the website is 80% ready. All of the features were basically completed, eventhough I still need to test it further.‚ù§Ô∏è

</div>

There are a lot of features, where you can divide the website into three sides:

- user side
- instructor side
- admin side

Each one of them has its own unique difficulty to develop. In `user side`, I struggle a lot with payment gateway configuration, since the website need to talk to third party for the payment gateway, in this case I use [Midtrans](https://midtrans.com/), which is one of the biggest payment gateway providers in Indonesia. So, basically I need to configure how user could request for payment interface, where then they could the payment related to stuff they added in the cart. The problem is, whenever the user made the payment, my system have to know about the payment being made. This is needed because my system need to open the access for the user, so the user could watch the course they bought. This have to be made automatically.

For the `instructor side`, I found it difficult to integrate Youtube API for my uploaded course. So, basically I decided to go with Youtube to host my videos because they are free and I didn't need to hassle with storage, since this is still in early development. I needed to track the duration of every video I uploaded so it could be synced with the data in my database. Apart from that, the course progress tracking was also became a new thing for me. üëç

Last but not least, the `admin side`. Actually, I didn't find much difficulty related to this side, since it was basically about tracking things that the users and instructors did. However, developing a coupon feature was a whole new knowledge for me.

I still have a lot of homework, for instance, I still need to figure out about the deployment, the marketing, and also the process of content creation. I know that there are a hella work to do, but, I know that these all will be worth it in the future. So, I guess I will end this article and see you in the next part.

Thank you. üôè
