English is not my first language. I was born and have been living since in Indonesia until now. Being born in a third-world country where people don't speak English daily, learning English become a must. Until my college time, I was very bad at English. I barely passed any kind of English tests that I took. My ability was nowhere near my friends' in the college. That's when I decided to learn it more seriously. Thanks to the advancement of internet, I could do that without joining any formal courses or training that I didn't really have any money to spend on. I started to listening more English songs, watching Youtube videos and foreign movies with English speaker, whenever I could. My ability increased rapidly during that period. I was really good at listening and reading, which is categorized as a passive skills in English. But when it came to active skills, which are speaking and writing, I struggled a lot, even now. That's why I tried to write a lot in English so that I could be better in terms of this active skill. I still find it difficult to improve my speaking since speaking is at a lot of different spectrum, where you need someone to talk to. But, that is another case. I will try to find a way to train my speaking skills.
So these are things that I've learned along the way related to writing.

Here are the names for all the sentence parts you'll need:

## Clause

A clause can be a whole sentence or part of a sentence. A clause is made up of a subject and a predicate. "I know" is an example of a clause, with "I" as the subject and "know" as the predicate. There are two types of clauses: dependent and independent.

### Independent clause

An independent clause can make sense by itself. For example, "This cat is silly." is an independent clause.

### Dependent clause

A dependent clause that cannot make sense by itself. Examples of dependent clauses are "When I grow up," "Since the last time I saw you," "After we had finished doing the dishes," and "Now that she finished high school." Do you notice that all the examples start with a word or phrase like since, after, and now that? These are called subordinating conjunctions.

## Conjunction

A conjunction links two clauses together. And, but, and or are the most common conjunctions, but there are many, many more.

### Coordinating conjunction

A coordinating conjunction links two independent clauses. The coordinating conjunction is in italics in the following examples:

- "I love pancakes, but I hate waffles."
- "Should I stay, or should I go?"
- "We went shopping, and then we came home."

### Subordinating conjunction

A subordinating conjunction links a dependent clause to an independent clause. The subordinating conjunction is in italics in the following examples:

- "When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut."
- "A lot has changed since the last time I saw you."
- "After we had finished doing the dishes, we decided to go for a long walk."
- "What will she do now that she has finished high school?"

## Sentence Structures

### Simple sentence

A simple sentence is made up of `one independent clause`. You can easily identify simple sentences because they only have one verb. Here are some examples:

- "I am an engineer."
- "Software developer is smart."
- "Do you like writing?"

### Compound sentence.

A compound sentence is made of `two independent clauses` and `a conjunction`, like this: `[independent clause]` + `[coordinating conjunction]` + `[independent clause]`. You can tell that it's a compound sentence by getting rid of the conjunction and creating two simple sentences. For example, "My cat's name is George, and he is very playful" can be broken up into "My cat's name is George." and "He loves pancakes." Here are some examples:

- "To be or not to be?"
- "I just jogged five miles, and I feel great!"
- "My cat's name is George, and he is very playful."

### Complex sentence

A complex sentence is made of `one independent clause`, `one dependent clause`, and `a subordinating conjunction`. Complex sentences can be put together in two ways: `[subordinating conjunction]` + `[dependent clause]` + comma + `[independent clause]`. OR `[independent clause]` + `[subordinating conjunction]` + `[dependent clause]`. You can tell that it's a complex sentence because if you take away the conjunctions and turn it into two sentences, one of the clauses will not make sense by itself. Here are some examples:

- Even though he was worried, he tried to put it out of his mind.
- My sister puts on makeup whenever she goes out.
- If you want me to make dinner, we'll be having pasta.

### Compound-complex sentence

A compound-complex sentence consists of `at least two independent clauses` and `at least one dependent clause`. There are many ways to put together a compound-complex sentence. You can tell that it's a compound-complex sentence by getting rid of the conjunctions and looking at each clause. If there are at least two independent clauses and one dependent clause, then it's a compound-complex sentence. Here are some examples:

- "If you will let me, I would like to show you how sentences are formed and teach you to master the English language."
- "When he arrived at the airport terminal, he put down his bag and looked around him."

## Conditional

### Zero conditional

We use the zero conditional to talk about things that are generally true, especially for laws and rules.

- If I drink too much coffee, I can't sleep at night.
- Ice melts if you heat it.
- When the sun goes down, it gets dark.

The structure is: `if / when + present simple >> present simple`.

### First conditional

We use the first conditional when we talk about future situations we believe are real or possible.

- If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the beach.
- Arsenal will be top of the league if they win.
- When I finish work, I'll call you.

In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually: `if/when + present simple >> will + infinitive`.

It is also common to use this structure with unless, as long as, as soon as or in case instead of if.

- I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives.
- I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job.
- I'll give you a key in case I'm not at home.
- You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight.

### Second conditional

The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality.

- If we had a garden, we could have a cat.
- If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country.
- I wouldn't worry if I were you.

The structure is usually: `if + past simple >> + would + infinitive`.

When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she form.

- If I were you, I wouldn't mention it.
- If she was prime minister, she would invest more money in schools.
- He would travel more if he was younger.
