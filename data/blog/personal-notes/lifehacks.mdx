Ini merupakan artikel bahasa Indonesia pertama gue, terkait social hacks yang bisa kita gunakan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure toHeading={3} />

## Communications

### Sebelum bercerita atau bertanya, get the attention first

Penting buat kita get the person's attention sebelum kita mau menyampaikan sesuatu. Sesimpel "Eh, gue mau cerita nih" or "Eh, gue mau tanya penting nih". Dengan bilang kaya gitu, seakan kita mau nyampein sesuatu yang ga biasa.

## Leadership

### Leadership capacity starts from something small

Lu ga akan dianggap sebagai sosok leader kalo lu ga ngelakuin apa yang leader lakukan di hal-hal kecil dan mendasar. Jangan takut dan menolak kalo dikasih challenge. Jalanin aja sebisanya.

### Be a reliable source

Don't say anything if you are not sure about it. Just say valid informations.

### Make sure you are visible

Ikut sesuatu yang penting, yang berkaitan dengan orang penting, yang bisa membuat lu terlihat penting di hadapan orang-orang penting. This is the start of the pool of leadership talent. Always try to be a high achiever. Those who are visible are front of mind when decisions get made. Don't hide your light under your bushel.

### Being a go to person in one or many aspects

Make sure your works stands out as being exceptional. Jadi ketika lu punya track record yang bagus dalam suatu hal, lu bisa dijadiin go to person.

### Level up your lid

Ukur performa leadership lu dari skala 1-10. That's your leadership lid. Lu cuma bisa lead orang-orang yang level leadership lid nya dibawah lu.

### Belajar tentang bagaimana menginfluence orang

Dengan cara berbicara lu, cara bersikap dan get things done.

### Tetapkan roadmap untuk track process

Don't be passive and just vibing. Take initiative. Make a strategy, execute and refine.

### Serve others

Leaders add values by serving others. Do a favor for someone elses.

### Connection and magnetism

A good leader develop credibility and building a good connection with other leaders. This will lead another leader onto you. Also a leader's potential is determined by those closest to him. Surround yourself with people with good leadership ability.

### Keep your priorities straight

Leaders know their priority and act based on it.

## Lingkungan baru

### Tetapkan dari awal kita mau jadi pribadi yang seperti apa

First impression lasts long. Ketika orang udah ngeliat kita pertama kali sebagai orang yang memiliki karakter A, dia akan selalu beranggapan begitu. It resonates along the time dan kita juga jadi bilang ke diri kita, "Ah gue udah dikenal sebagai seorang A, gue lanjutin aja kaya gini terus". Because changing direction is so much harder than just cruising straight.

### Get to know everyone

Jangan pilih-pilih teman, pastikan kenal semua orang di lingkunganmu dan konsisten dalam menyapa. Building a network increases resources and the ability to problem solve quickly. People help people they like, if you are friendly and socialise with your coworkers they will like you more

### Ikut komunitas

Ikut acara-acara dan komunitas-komunitas yang ada di lingkunganmu. One of the biggest superpowers is the ability to show up every day.

## General

### Maintain your physical appearance

Orang lebih tertarik berinteraksi dengan orang yang in a good shape.

### Being as good as possible

Don't you dare settle for decent.

### Learn from mistakes

Ketika membuat suatu kesalahan selalu tanyakan, 'What have I got to learn here?'. Kalau perlu buat logbook mistakes. Be a goldfish- don't dwell on mistakes from the past.

### Ketika clash dengan orang lain

Be curious, not judgmental. All people are different people. Forgiveness is something you give for yourself, not for someone else.

### Ketika pekerjaan kita tidak menghasilkan

Take a different perspective. The harder you work the luckier you get.

### Don't be scared to look foolish

Like Ted Lasso.

### I have found that one's career suddenly becomes more interesting if you view it as a game of strategy

I dislike power or authority...well rather I am indifferent to it. I generally dont like having power over people, or other people having power over me - I think that people would be happier if they simply had more personal agency etc.

But the world isnt like that is it? People are children, and they must play the games....office politics, dress codes, tradition, social convention, status, ladder climbing, power structures and adherence, gossip, competition, etc. It's all petty, trite and annoying. I have no use for it. Actually I find it tiring!!

HOWEVER, as soon as you view it as an elaborate game of strategy, it becomes thrilling and fun, particularity if you can master a game that you have little interest in taking seriously!. Also you should always 'play' ethically!!!

Anyway, I began reading books about how to read and use bodylanguage effectively, books on emotional intelligence, on how to be well liked by the people in your office, how to dress well, how to impress the right people, etc. It's a very fascinating puzzle and I find that it makes it easier to be 'ambitious' when you view it that way. And it can get you that promotion faster, and in theory, a promotion can result in a more satisfying job, if you do it right. I'm more concerned with enjoying my job than status or money. Add to that, that my position involves event planning for non-profit - that in itself is a giant game of strategy because you have to think of all sorts of different ways of getting rich folks let go of their money for a good cause. An yess, I do love a delicious, delicious strategy game.

Look at working out as an RPG. Every extra plate you put on makes you just that much stronger. Except you can't save and shut it off, and if you idle for more than a few days, you start losing progress.

### When you seem to procrastinate

The easiest way to get out of a procrastination cycle is to prepare to do work. Tell yourself you're just going to take out your books, nothing more. Just going to open the file you were working on yesterday - no pressure. Just going to check for errors in your notes, no harm in that, right? Not like you're working! You've constructed a mental barricade against what you're supposed to do, but there is nothing defending the individual parts of the barricade! You just need to go into 'flow state'.

### Use google calendar

Use that tool. Remember person's birthday.

### Think of your future self

How will my future self feel in an hour or two if I skip my gym session? Will my future self be happy if I do this pile of dishes now, before bed? Or would he prefer to have to do it in the morning, before work? I have a three month deadline on this project, will my future self appreciate my current self taking the first three or four weeks easy, or will he be really pissed off?

## Mantra

### Jika kamu pernah merasa takut

Every lesson comes with a price. The faster you learn, the smaller the price.

### Jika kamu pernah merasa melakukan hal yang sia-sia

Everything in life comes with a price. It's about deciding which costs we are willing to pay.

### Jika kamu merasa tidak berada di lingkungan yang tepat

Self-development isn't about finding a great work environment. It's about becoming a person great work environment WANT to have. Wealth isn't about extracting value from others. It's about adding 10x as much value as you want to receive. You can't please everyone. Please the people who are who you want to become.

## Work

### Jika ada trouble

Seengganya ada progress yang dilakukan, jangan sekedar mereport aja. Harus sat set dan jangan ga enakan. Inget bahwa semua dibayar sesuai dengan porsinya masing-masing.

### Perluas jaringan

Untuk kemudahan koordinasi dan perijinan.
