Being a leader in technology industry has always been my dream since I was a kid. This started from my childhood experience when my uncle often invited me to visit the company where he worked. My uncle is an engineering manager at a multinational glass company. One thing that I admire from my uncle is his ability to lead, both in the work environment and in family life. I witnessed how the expatriates in the company gave my uncle more respect, even though my uncle were much younger than theirs. In the Batak tradition itself, the bone figure is a figure that we must uphold in honor, because of his position as a brother to our mother, who has always looked after and protected her since childhood. Because of the closeness of a bone and a bere (nephew) in Batak customs, I often ask for bone direction and input about my future life plans. This is what caused me to follow in the footsteps of uncle to pursue education and become an engineer in the field of mechanical engineering. I also aspire to be able to follow in his footsteps to become a leader in a large company that fits my field.
After college, I spent my entire working life in a field related to air transportation. I worked in an aircraft maintenance company and then in a state-owned company engaged in airport operations, for three years each. The first thing I learned from the development of the aviation industry is that as technology develops and changes in the lifestyle of the wider community, it is increasingly clear that the need for a reliable and safe mode of air transportation will also experience significant development. To meet all these developments, new strategies, technologies and business development patterns are also needed so that our aviation industry can be ready to face market changes. This brings us to the first problem in the aviation industry, namely the very fast movement of market changes.

In addition, during my six-year career, I realized that Indonesia has great potential to grow as one of the countries with the largest air traffic in the world. This is supported by the fact that our country is one of the countries with the largest population in the world, and also the geographical condition of our country which is an archipelagic country. This causes the demand for air transportation needs to grow from year to year. In fact, IATA (International Air Transport Association) predicts that in 2039, Indonesia will become the country with the 4th largest number of airplane passengers in the world, up significantly from its current position at number 10 in the world. This becomes the second problem for the Indonesian aviation industry, whether we are able to face a significant increase in passenger capacity with limited resources.
The last problem that should be highlighted is that there are still imbalances in the development of infrastructure and transportation facilities, especially air transportation facilities in a number of regions. In fact, this transportation facility is very crucial in supporting the economic growth of a region. In addition, the existence of qualified transportation facilities will also form a sustainable transportation system which will have a direct impact on the quality of life of the people in the area.

These three problems will become crucial problems and become tasks that must be resolved, if we want to see our aviation industry continue to grow. Based on these facts, I see that this is an opportunity as well as a challenge for me to take an important role in supporting the development of the aviation industry in Indonesia. For that, I have committed to continue my career and continue to hone my knowledge, skills and experience in this field. Then, why did I decide to major in engineering and technology management? During my career, I learned a lot from the technical side of the aviation industry. However, along with the experience of handling several company projects and the growing interest in the scope of business management of the aviation industry as a whole, I am targeting to be able to have a career in structural positions in the future, especially with the opportunity for a career pattern in a very broad company to accommodate this.

However, I realized that I still had a lot to learn as well as many shortcomings that I had to work on before I was fully ready to take on this responsibility. Along with the informal learning process through direct work experience and knowledge sharing activities with colleagues, the formal learning process is also very important to carry out. This has encouraged me to improve my competence by participating in the master's degree program in engineering and technology management. The master's degree program focuses on increasing the ability of students to become leaders in companies by prioritizing technological innovation capabilities to optimize company performance in accordance with market needs.

Upon returning from the educational process, I have high hopes that I will be able to apply the technical and management knowledge that I have gained to help overcome the problems that occur in the Indonesian aviation industry.

Post Study Plan and Contribution Plan in Indonesia

After doing a lot of research and consulting with several parties that I consider credible, I believe that the engineering and technology management program is the most suitable program for my future career plans. This is based on the syllabus of each program that I have chosen to reflect the things that I must master to be able to have a professional career within the scope of management of a company.

The first thing I will do after my studies is use the knowledge of project planning and control and project management, as well as apply the knowledge about risk management and engineering finance that I gained during my studies into the scope of my work. Based on past observations and financial reports of the company, I found that there are still many projects that are not properly implemented, asset procurement, or business expansion, which results in the company's financial performance being not optimal. This is exacerbated by the decline in national flight conditions due to a pandemic that has been running for almost three years, which has caused the company to lose some sources of income and must be as effective as possible in cutting operational costs, of course without compromising service standards and safety aspects for customers. So, like it or not, every company plan, whether related to project procurement or business expansion, must be effective and go through careful planning. For that, as an engineer in a company, I will use the knowledge I have gained to manage the development projects that I handle more effectively both in terms of planning and implementation, as well as optimizing the management of the allocation of resources owned by the company. With this, the company can expand its business in accordance with market needs and unlock the potential for business diversification while taking into account the economic value and long-term impact. This will certainly help in dealing with the first problem of the Indonesian aviation industry related to the rapid movement of market changes.
Along with increasing my knowledge, experience and experience in the field of management, I will participate in a job tender in the company. One of my targets is to become a leader in the Airport Engineering Development department, which is tasked with developing or acquiring airports that have the potential to serve as national hubs for aviation activities in Indonesia. One thing that should be known is that developing a system to carry out the operational activities of an airport is very dependent on careful planning and execution on all fronts. This is because, in this industry, safety is the main goal. Good management skills are needed to harmonize the performance of all lines, starting from passenger service, baggage handling, equipment readiness on the ground and air sides, as well as coordination with airlines and air traffic controllers. By utilizing the corporate management skills gained from the learning process in college, it will really help me to achieve this goal.

In addition, the emergence of new technologies will indirectly affect the pattern of relations between business people and customers in various industrial sectors. Companies are required to continue to innovate if they do not want to be left behind in business competition, not least in the aviation sector. For example, smart airports are one of the most talked about and expected to be the standard for every airport in the future. Biometric verification and smart baggage handling systems are some examples of technologies that are being developed and used a lot. In addition, the use of big data analysis to assist in the decision-making process for stakeholders has also been widely applied in foreign countries. These two examples are examples of technology that is already quite developed, but has not been widely applied in Indonesia. In fact, by utilizing these technologies appropriately, it can increase the effectiveness and reliability of an airport's operational activities. With the opportunity to study in a country with rapid technological development, I am sure that I will get exposure to the latest technologies in various fields and how to properly apply them in my field of study. In return, I will actively provide input to companies regarding innovations and technologies that can be applied, through the platforms provided by the company.
By utilizing management skills coupled with the ability to innovate as previously mentioned, I believe I can play a role in helping companies to maximize their assets and optimize investments that will be made to overcome the second problem in our aviation industry, namely increasing demand and capacity. air traffic passengers by utilizing limited resources.

With my great interest in company development, I also intend to join an independent work unit outside the company's organizational structure. This unit is called the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and has a scope of work in evaluating investments made by the company as well as the function of supervising the planning, development and implementation of large company projects. In PIU, I can apply my management skills and help the company grow at the same time. Having wide exposure to various parties will also be a very useful benefit for my future development. For this reason, I can use the intrapersonal, communication and people-management skills that I gained during my studies, to be able to build good relationships with various parties, so that I can be more effective in working in a team. Especially with the status of the company that has just become part of the aviation-tourism holding group based on the decision of the Ministry of SOEs. With the skills and knowledge I have gained, I can maximize myself in various potential collaborations and business expansions between corporate entities within the holding group. In return, I will collaborate within the holding group to develop programs related to the growth of the tourism sector in Indonesia. As we know, Indonesia is one of the richest countries in terms of natural and cultural wealth. However, according to the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index 2019 by the World Economic Forum, tourism growth in Indonesia in the last two decades has actually lagged behind other countries. This is related to the problems faced such as limited infrastructure, investment, and human resources that have not been able to compete compared to other countries. By collaborating with various parties, I believe I can help the main goal of the holding group to integrate various company functions in supporting the tourism sector, where in my field, namely the development of air transportation infrastructure at points that are considered potential. This will help strengthen competitiveness in the tourism sector as well as strengthen connectivity between regions in Indonesia. At the same time, this will also be useful in tackling the problems of the three aviation sectors in Indonesia, related to the uneven development of infrastructure and air transportation facilities in Indonesia.
