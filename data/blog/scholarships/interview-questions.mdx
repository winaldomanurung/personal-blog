I have tried LPDP two times in the past (not to mention several other scholarships where I also failed), and I believe that the main reason is that I didn't do enough preparation for the application. I didn't try hard enough and kept waiting near the deadline day to start my preparation. Now, I want to change it. Today, on `13 January 2024`, `29 years old me`, started my preparation for applying for scholarships. I still have 6 years maximum to get the LPDP scholarships before I meet the age limit, which will happen on `23 June 2029`. I know that I am a little bit old to start this, but it is better late than never.

Framework:
• Situation: Set the scene, making sure to add context and background information. “For my degree in journalism, I had to prepare a 10,000 word thesis on methods of community policing and how well they worked.”
• Task: Explain the issue you had to overcome or what you needed to achieve. “The challenge was to get a variety of voices from members of the police, academics, lobby groups and people in the community.”
• Action: Look at how you tackled the problem. What did you do? “I drew up a list of potential interviewees, then made initial contact by social media, telephone and email. I discussed the project with them and then decided who to interview.”
• Result: What was the outcome? Give details as to what happened as a result of your actions, if possible with figures. “The finished thesis featured 50 interviewees and included a wide variety of voices showing different viewpoints on the issue.”

## PERSONAL QUESTIONS

### What are your strengths?

- I am a fast learner. I have a framework in mind to make things look simple but structured. Besides, I have a strong curiosity. These two things got me used to learning things quickly.
- I have good teamwork skills. This is because, since school and college, I have been active in various organizations. This makes me comfortable working in a team.
- I am a problem-solver. I feel very happy and challenged when asked for an opinion on solving a problem. Because that way, I train myself more and more to think effectively.
- I have a strong commitment to doing something. Since childhood, I was taught to finish what we start with the best possible. I'm willing to sacrifice my personal pleasure if something I'm aiming for has not been achieved.
- I have good leadership skills. Several times as an organizational leader or as a project leader in the world of work, I have learned a lot about how to lead. I am always ready if given the mandate to lead.

### What are your weaknesses?

- I often act impulsively, taking actions based on moods. This often makes me make irrational decisions and regret them in the end. To overcome this, I began to practice self-control and my emotions.
- I am a stubborn person. Often I ignore input that could actually save me from making unnecessary mistakes. For that, I began to train myself to be open to the input given.
- I often choose the wrong priorities. I spend time on unnecessary details and cause the overall work to be less than optimal due to wasted time/energy. The solution is to make a detailed schedule in progress.

### Why do you want to continue your study?

Developing useful frameworks for responsible innovation and value sensitive design, through critical evaluation of technological advancements on the basis of fundamental values such as ethics and safety and frugality.
Currently, I am working at a state-owned enterprise in Indonesia which focusing on airport service and operation. Aviation business is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing demand for air travel and it shows no sign of stopping. International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasted Indonesia's aviation market to become the fourth-largest globally by 2039. I, personally, can see it as a challenge as well as an opportunity to take a big role in the future in this thriving industry. I aspire to be a leader in airport engineering development department, where I could have the chance to guide the evolution of aviation industry in my country.
Developing and managing an airport rests heavily on both the plan and execution. It takes many things into consideration, such as interaction with entire aviation system, financial aspect, as well as time and man management. I have realized that I need more advanced skill-sets and knowledge to engage in a leadership role in this industry. For that, I am eager to level up myself within Industrial Management master's degree program in KTH. I've found out that the subjects offered at this program are exactly what I need to master in order to fulfil my ambition.

### What's your contribution for the nation from the past until now?

### How is the situation of Indonesia's aviation field and what's the challenge?

1st problem: technology develops rapidly following the development of customer needs
2nd problem: the ability to cope with significant growth of passenger capacity with limited resources.
3rd problem: still imbalances in the development of infrastructure and transportation facilities, especially air transportation facilities in a number of regions.

### What's the urgency of getting the master's degree and what's the effect for your career and contribution for the nation?

Ever since the Covid-19 broke out in 2019, it has spread aggressively, resulting in the rapid declaration in aviation business. Since then, we have to adapt and think about the best industry strategies and practices to be adopted to suit the market condition. But, it doesn’t neglect the fact that aviation industry is still having a big potential to grow. It’s the fact that the needs for air transportation will always be there. However, we need a different approach to counter such crisis and steer the aviation sector towards systematic innovation and progression. We need new business models and approaches to recoup growth and revenue streams. Asia Pacific region is a lucrative regional market for the global Airport Infrastructure market. It is expected to dominate the market and will remain the largest region owing to the increase in air passenger traffic. Despite a minor growth dip owing to Covid-19 implications, the global airport infrastructure market is expected to recoup growth and register over USD 230 billion by 2028 ticking at a CAGR of 10.2%. The existence of proper infrastructure plays an important role as infrastructure has a direct relationship with the overall economic functioning of the surrounding area.

Emerging technologies and devices, such as smart access control systems, fingerprint readers, and smart card technology are being increasingly implemented by airports for enhancing the overall passenger experience. Additionally, with the introduction of smartphone-based airport applications, passengers are now able to utilize real-time information, such as gate number, arrival time, direction to airport, check-in line, and flight booking.
Based on the Smart Airport market development status, competitive landscape and development model in different regions of the world, this report is dedicated to providing niche markets, potential risks and comprehensive competitive strategy analysis in different fields. From the competitive advantages of different types of products and services, the development opportunities and consumption characteristics and structure analysis of the downstream application fields are all analyzed in detail. To Boost Growth during the epidemic era, this report analyzes in detail for the potential risks and opportunities which can be focused on.

### Why do you deserve this scholarships?

I won't claim that my credentials will blow away the competition or that I have some exceptionally rare skills that makes me suitable. Yes, I have an excellent GPA, I've done a lot of volunteer work, several extracurricular activities, and held down a job, and though I feel likee all of this makes me adequately qualified for the scholarships, I don't think that it sets me apart from other candidates. What sets me apart, and what I think is unique and special about me, is my combination of work ethic and my drive to succeed.

Doing all these concurrent activities has led me to develop a strong work ethic and a strong ability to prioritize, manage my time, and make sure that I always get my work done on time. I think that my accomplishments, and my drive and perseverance to contunue accomplishing, have and will lead me to success.

As I understand, this program is very competitive and only accepts top-level students. However, I am convinced that my good study and professional record, combined with my organizational experience will enhance my chance to succeed within this program. I would be truly honored if you decide to accept my candidateship to be a student at KTH in 2021.

### Where do you see yourself in the next 10 years?

### What is your most valuable experience?

When I was in college, I had an interest in robotics. I attended trainings and learned independently about robotics with the aim of breaking through to the university robot team. However, when I joined the open recruitment, I was declared not to have passed the selection because my technical test results were considered unsatisfactory. I was disappointed and was envious of my friends who were successfully accepted. However, I was determined not to stop. I continue my learning process and do a lot of sharing with my seniors and friends in the robot team. Until finally the following year I returned to participate in the open recruitment for the university robot team. At the time of the announcement of the results of the selection, the things that I strived for paid off. I was accepted into the mechanical and design team for the legged robot category. Along with that euphoria, I was determined to give my best for the team. I spend time outside of college working with a team. Often I find it difficult to complete assignments from campus because I am busy working on robotic projects. However, in the end, it all paid off when our robot won several awards at a robot competition held by DIKTI. The thing I am most proud of is that our robot won an award in the Best Design category, something I worked so hard for during the six months I worked on. This is very proud for me, because starting from someone whose technical ability is considered lacking, in the end with hard work and high fighting spirit, I was finally able to contribute to presenting a degree for the university.

### Experience

Being appointed and given the trust to lead an organization is a matter of pride for many people. Likewise with me, when I was appointed to lead an organization majoring in student creativity. Moreover, this was my first experience in leading an organization. There I became chairman of the mechatronics organization in the mechanical engineering department. However, as time went on, something unpleasant happened during my tenure. This started when during my leadership period, mechatronics organizations were considered to be less successful than automotive and aeronautical organizations. This is due to our lack of knowledge in the field of mechatronics, so we rarely participate in competitions related to mechatronics and I prefer to allocate the existing budget for training costs for members. For information, the field of mechatronics itself is not taught directly within the scope of mechanical engineering, because of its nature which is indeed a combination of mechanical science, electronics and informatics. Because of this assumption, the articles of association given to us were cut, and channeled to other organizations deemed more in need. At first, I was angry and did not accept this. However, after doing some introspection and communicating with related parties, I realized that the mistake started with me as the leader of the organization. At that time, I rarely communicated what we were doing in the organization with other parties. This caused many parties to think that the performance of our organization was not effective and the work programs that I compiled at that time were not able to accommodate the creative interests of the members. I also rarely share with leaders from other organizations on how to develop effective and efficient training patterns. From there I apologized, and was determined to correct my mistakes and become a better leader. I started hanging out a lot with friends across majors, from electrical engineering, informatics engineering, or electronics and instrumentation (Elins) and created a training pattern that didn't cost a lot of money, by cooperating with friends from these majors to give sharing sessions. about their respective fields of knowledge. On the other hand, we also held several sharing sessions regarding the mechanical field. That way, the existing costs can be diverted to the activities of the competition. In addition, I also began to build better communication with parties outside the organization regarding our work program.

### Experience

After graduating from college, I regularly attend trainings that can improve my competence. However, one of the most memorable trainings was the programming training that I attended for six months starting in early 2022. I took a bootcamp program for the software development field. Initially, I decided to join this program to open up knowledge about the digital field which is increasingly being applied in this era. I also feel difficulties because I do not have an IT background. The tasks given, including personal projects and group projects, require me to actively seek and conduct research to determine the best algorithm in compiling a program. I learned many things from the training, ranging from technical lessons about what technologies are used in the programming world, how to collaborate and build projects in teams, and how to build simple and structured logic to solve a problem. However, one of the most important lessons in my opinion is about the mindset in dealing with problems. Often I am faced with very difficult and complex problems. However, by doing research, trial and error, communicating with mentors or training partners, and doing it persistently, all the problems I faced were resolved in the end. It doesn't matter if I have to do it for hours or even days, but the solution will surely emerge later. The heavy tasks that I managed to complete made me more confident in carrying out the next tasks. This instilled an important mindset in me. It doesn't matter if I can't finish it now, as long as I keep learning and never give up, someday I'll get over it. So, whenever I face a problem that I don't know the solution to, I always say, "Don't worry, you are going to figure it out, just like you always have".

### Experience

Working in the engineering team in charge of maintaining the condition of the equipment, I was once the cause of equipment damage. This happened when I received directions to monitor the airfield lighting system, which is a flight aid for airplanes to take off and land. When checking, I found that one of the runway lights was damaged. At that time I worked with one of the outsourced personnel in our company. I also gave directions to the outsourced officer to make repairs, but during the reinstallation process I made an error. I did not re-check the work thoroughly. There is one cable that is interchanged. When the appliance is turned on again, an instantaneous short circuit occurs in the cable network which causes some of the airfield lights to turn off. This caused the airport runway at that time to only use part of the lighting system. Fortunately this did not interfere much with flight activities at that time. I immediately made repairs to the system that experienced a short circuit. Although it did not experience much difficulty in repairing it, the news was heard by the branch leadership. The next day, I was called by the branch manager and safety risk management personnel for questioning. I admit my mistakes and apologize for the mistakes I have made. They also understood my mistake, because at the time of the incident, I was still a junior engineer. However, this really made an impression on me, because it taught me a lesson to always be careful in my work. Especially with my work status which is directly related to flight safety.

### Experience

While working at GMF AeroAsia, I was assigned to the Engineering Services department in a newly formed unit called Part Manufacturer Approval (PMA). This PMA unit has the authority to carry out the manufacturing process or modification of aircraft parts. With this PMA, airlines in Indonesia will not need to import aircraft parts at high prices. Instead, they can use locally made products that have the same quality as imported parts but at a more affordable price. Working in this unit when it was first formed, I had the opportunity to engage in two fields at once, namely the design process and research and development. However, at the same time, each engineer must also handle a project to be developed. At that time I received an assignment to handle the development of a pilot project for the manufacture of cup holder parts for the ATR27-600 aircraft. At first, I worked on a task that was indeed my daily task, namely designing the parts to be made and doing material research. However, due to limited personnel, it turns out that I also have to intervene in other matters such as making feasibility studies, submitting budgets, and communicating with manufacturing vendors. After that, I also had to communicate intensely with the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DKPPU) in the equipment certification process. Until finally, the part was successfully certified and can be marketed and sold to customers. In response to this, I actually feel happy because I have the opportunity to be able to learn many things directly in one project that I am working on. This is a plus point for me personally, seeing that colleagues in other units do not get the same opportunities because the job descriptions have been divided in an organized manner. Despite the impact, I had to work harder and several times overtime, especially during the management of the certification process due to the large number of files and documents that had to be fulfilled. However, I think it was one of the most valuable experiences for my personal development in the world of work.

### Experience

A strong background of work experience makes me confident in my career goals and has a clear plan on how I will take advantage of the results of this education after the learning period is over. I think that is what makes me different and makes me stand out from other participants. Previously, I had also applied for an LPDP scholarship when I had not even worked for a year. At that time I had a failure. But I realized why I didn't pass at that time, because I hadn't fully figured out the 'why' factor or why I had to continue my studies. After all, I don't have much experience and instead I will learn more by getting directly involved in the industry. However, this time I already have a clear career plan, where the company where I work is also very open for me to run it. With the experience I have, I think this is the right time to upgrade my competence to take on greater responsibilities in the future.

# MAJOR AND UNIVERSITY RELATED QUESTIONS

### Why did you choose this major?

So, when I was researching the university, I wanted to consider several factors. The first one is the program suitability. The focus is to find a university and its degree that suits my career plan. I've found out that the program structure in my selected program complements my professional background as well as aligns with my future career plan, which is to become a leader in my company.
Besides that, I looked for a collaborative environment in the university, because I realized that in the future I will need to be comfortable working in a team whether it is as a member or a leader. And based on my research, TU Delft is one of the best universities related to student projects where dynamic cultures from all around the world meet and work together. There are a lot of opportunities for students to work together within a large number of research groups within and outside TU Delft. For example, TU Delft cooperates at a regional level with other NL universities to conduct their research. In addition, many students gain international experience by going abroad to participate in internships at companies in various fields.
And last but not least, the state of the country is also become a key factor. I aim to study in a country where the technology is well-developed and has a good developing environment. Some of the factors related to this are tech knowledge, preparedness for developing new technologies, and the capability to create and advance innovations.
