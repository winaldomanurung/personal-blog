I am a mechanical engineer and a self-taught developer driven by a genuine love for creating things.

Motivated by the belief that learning should be a collaborative and inclusive experience, I dedicate myself to share my insights, experiences, and the wealth of information that I've gathered on my learning process.

In this ever-evolving digital world, I find joy in turning ideas into reality and fostering a community where knowledge is shared and creativity knows no bounds. Join my programming journey of continuous learning and creative exploration.
